//The app is locked for only for users that are signed in so make an account before you start coding

//I made all the routes that we will be using (at least necessary for navbar)
//I made the navbar appear only after onboarding and login and have position fixed on top of the content.
//You just have to make it
//For styling you can check the app.css file to see what I predefined. You can predefine more if you need to.
//I made some padding, corner radius and text styles. If you want to make text bold in tailwind you write font-bold
//Tell chat that we are using tailwind but you can allways choose to use normal css.
//In the app.css there is a "/* Regular css classes here */" and you can put regular classes there"
//Good luck 🤞😉
